# ERP based BCI data classifier
This is the project developed during Brain Computer Interface course at Nazarbayev University. Two ensemble learning classifiers based on weighted average method are proposed in order to produce robust results for many subjects utilizing generic training (GT). The models utilized to create ensemble algorithms are linear discriminant analysis (LDA), linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) models. The proposed models are trained and tested on four datasets including ALS, NU, BNCI, EPFLP. The model based on LDA-SVC-kNN outperformed other models on two datasets with highest f-score of 94.31.
